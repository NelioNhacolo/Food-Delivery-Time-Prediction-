# Food-Delivery-Time-Prediction-
 Machine Learning algorithms to predict the food delivery time based on how much time the delivery partners took for the same distance in the past.

This folder consists of 7 documents:
  *DeliveryTime.xlsx
  *Food Delivery Time By Nelio Lino Nhacolo.ipynb
  *Food Delivery Time By Nelio Lino Nhacolo.pdf
  *Lino.png
  *Nelio.png
  *new_data.csv
  *Time Prediction with Power BI.pbix
  
Take Note:
  *Please install Jupyter Nootebook to be able to run and execute: Food Delivery Time By Nelio Lino Nhacolo.ipynb or you can run it using visual code.
  *Download documents in the same folder, if you don't it won't execute correctly.
  *Food Delivery Time By Nelio Lino Nhacolo.pdf consists of all the work that has been done using Jupyter Nootebook and Power Bi. 
  *When you run the code give it time to execute.
  *After running this code "data.to_csv("new_data.csv", index = False)" you will notice that new_data.csv will be created again in the folder, you can remove or
   Leave it, it doesn't matter much. 
   
 Thank you, hope you enjoy my work.
